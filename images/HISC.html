    <h1>How I Started Coding</h1>
    <p>
        I started Coding when I was 17 years old and Just got addmission in MCT's RGIT college in Computer Engineering. <br>
        I was very much interested in coding and wanted to learn it. I started with HTML and CSS and then moved on to JavaScript and Python. <br>
        I have also learned C programming language and have done some projects in it. while currently learning C#. <br>
        I am still learning and exploring new technologies in the field of coding. <br>
        When I enrolled for IIT madras online course, I was very much excited and eager to learn. <br> 
        I have learned a lot from the course and it has helped me to improve my coding skills.  <br>
        I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from such a prestigious institution.
